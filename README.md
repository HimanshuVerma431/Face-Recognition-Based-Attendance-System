The Face Recognition Based Attendance System is an AI-powered solution designed to automate and streamline the process of taking attendance in educational institutions, workplaces, or events. This system uses real-time facial recognition to identify and verify individuals, marking their attendance accurately without any manual intervention.

Key Features:

Face Detection and Recognition: Utilizes OpenCV and deep learning models (e.g., CNN, Haar Cascades, or pre-trained models like FaceNet or Dlib) to detect and recognize faces in real-time.

Live Video Capture: Captures real-time video input from a webcam or IP camera to identify registered users.

Database Integration: Stores user details and attendance logs in a database (e.g., SQLite, MySQL).

Automation: Automatically marks attendance once the person is recognized, eliminating the need for manual entries.

Accuracy & Security: Reduces the chances of proxy attendance and ensures secure authentication.

User-Friendly Interface: Built with a simple GUI using Python libraries like Tkinter or PyQt.

Tech Stack:

Programming Language: Python

Libraries/Tools: OpenCV, NumPy, Dlib or FaceNet, Pandas, Tkinter/PyQt, SQLite/MySQL

Deployment: Local machine or LAN-based server setup

Outcome:
This system improves the accuracy, efficiency, and reliability of attendance management while minimizing human errors and fraud. It also saves time and resources in organizational settings where traditional methods are cumbersome.
